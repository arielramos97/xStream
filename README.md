# xStream

**Python** implementation of the xStream algorithm proposed by the paper:

https://cmuxstream.github.io/

* xStream detects outliers in feature-evolving data streams, where the full feature-space is unknown a-priori and evolves over time.

* xStream is accurate in all three settings: (i) static data, (ii) row-streams, and (iii) feature-evolving streams, as demonstrated over multiple datasets in each setting.

## Demonstration

We've set up a Google Colab notebook, which fits and scores the datapoints as described in the paper.
